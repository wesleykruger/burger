# Burger Barn
This is a Node.js application developed with Handlebars.js and MySQL to simulate a burger restaurant's current orders.

## Getting Started
This app is hosted on Heroku, so it can be accessed at: https://wkruger-burger.herokuapp.com/. If you want to run it locally, you will need Node.js and the project's associated packages.

## Running the project
The program can take in burger orders and store whether they have yet to be eaten. Its API can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE any burgers on the back-end, and it is all stored in a relational MySQL database for persistance.
Add a burger using the "Can I take your order" submission field, then play around with the different statuses of the burger.
